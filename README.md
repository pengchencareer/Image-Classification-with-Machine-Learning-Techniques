# Image-Classification-with-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This is my graduate project with Python, where I converted images into real data, cleaned the data, extracted the features and analyzed data with different machine learning techniques, including decision tree, random forest, logistic regression and K Nearest Neighbors techniques. Finally, I improved the accuracy of fruit image classification up to 98 %.

The paper is almost ready to be published. The current version is ready to view.
