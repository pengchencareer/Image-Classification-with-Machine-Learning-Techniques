# Image-Classification-with-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This is my graduation project, where I converted > 10,000 fruit images into numeric data with OpenCV in Python to discover the optimal Machine Learning (ML) technique on fruit image classification. Untimately, I developed an optimal model, which improved classification accuracy up to 96.7%.

The paper is almost ready to be published. The current version is ready to view.
